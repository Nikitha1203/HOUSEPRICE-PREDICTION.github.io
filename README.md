INTRODUCTION: 
House price prediction is a project that aims to estimate the value of residential properties using data analysis and machine learning techniques. By analyzing factors such as location, size, and features of houses, we can develop models that forecast their prices accurately. These models can help buyers make informed decisions and sellers set competitive prices. Throughout this project, we will explore the process of building a reliable house price prediction model using historical housing data.
